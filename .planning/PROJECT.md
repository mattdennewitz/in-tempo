# InTempo

## What This Is

A browser-based generative performance engine inspired by Terry Riley's "In C." Simulated performers independently navigate a shared score of short melodic patterns, following Riley's coordination rules — stay within a few patterns of each other, repeat freely, drop out and rejoin — producing an emergent, shifting tapestry of sound. Three composition modes (Riley's original, generative, Euclidean) with sampled and synthesized instruments. Built with the Web Audio API for rock-solid timing, React + shadcn + Vite for the interface.

## Core Value

The ensemble behavior must feel alive — performers making believable musical decisions (repetition, dropouts, unison-seeking, density-awareness) over a precisely timed audio engine, so each performance is unique and compelling to watch and listen to.

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ Precalculated score from Riley's 53 patterns as default mode — v1.0
- ✓ Algorithmically generated score mode (patterns in the style of In C) — v1.0
- ✓ Euclidean mode: patterns generated by Bjorklund's algorithm — v1.0
- ✓ Dynamic performer count — add/remove players before or during performance — v1.0
- ✓ Emergent performer AI: weighted decisions, band enforcement, dropout/rejoin, unison-seeking — v1.0
- ✓ Riley's rules enforced: sequential traversal, 2-3 pattern band, no skipping backward — v1.0
- ✓ Toggleable steady eighth-note pulse (high C) — v1.0
- ✓ User-configurable global BPM — v1.0
- ✓ Start, stop, and reset performance controls — v1.0
- ✓ User is a spectator — no interaction with individual performers during performance — v1.0
- ✓ Mix of synth and sampled instrument voices (piano, marimba), assigned per-player — v1.0
- ✓ Per-performer status: playing/silent, current pattern number, rep tracking — v1.0
- ✓ Canvas-based performer visualization — v1.0
- ✓ Natural fade ending: performers drop out one by one — v1.0
- ✓ Rock-solid Web Audio API timing (AudioContext lookahead scheduling) — v1.0

### Active

- [ ] MIDI file export of generated performances (downloadable .mid)
- [ ] Velocity humanization — subtle per-note velocity variation in audio and MIDI
- [ ] Default performer count reduced to 4

### Out of Scope

- Real-time multiplayer (human performers over network) — too complex
- Mobile-optimized layout — desktop-first
- Recording/export to audio file (WAV/MP3) — MIDI export covers notation needs
- User conducting/intervention during performance — spectator only by design
- Stereo spread — deferred from v1.0
- GT Canon font — deferred, Courier fallback works
- Abstract geometry visualization — deferred from v1.0
- Semafor/FT color palette — deferred from v1.0

## Context

Terry Riley's "In C" (1964) is a seminal minimalist composition. 53 short melodic modules are played in sequence by any number of performers. The magic is in the simple rules: go in order, repeat freely, stay close to each other, listen and adjust. This produces emergent phasing, canonic textures, and dynamic waves without a conductor.

Shipped v1.0 with 3,597 LOC TypeScript/TSX across 4 phases (11 plans).
Tech stack: React 19, Vite, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS v4, Web Audio API (AudioWorklet), smplr for sampled instruments.

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: React + shadcn/ui + Vite for UI; Web Audio API for all audio
- **Font**: GT Canon (user will provide the font files); Courier New as fallback
- **Timing**: All note scheduling must use AudioContext.currentTime lookahead, never setTimeout/setInterval for musical timing
- **Browser**: Modern Chromium-based browsers as primary target (best Web Audio support)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Spectator-only interaction | Preserves the emergent, self-organizing nature of the piece | ✓ Good |
| Emergent AI over simple random | Weighted decisions with band enforcement produce believable musical behavior | ✓ Good |
| Precalculate score | Avoids runtime computation; enables visualization ahead of playback | ✓ Good |
| AudioWorklet for synthesis | Dedicated audio thread prevents main-thread jank from blocking audio | ✓ Good |
| Lookahead scheduler (Two Clocks) | Chris Wilson pattern: schedule ahead via currentTime for glitch-free timing | ✓ Good |
| Immutable frozen snapshots per tick | Prevents order-of-evaluation bugs across performer agents | ✓ Good |
| Voice pool with stealing | Oldest-voice stealing handles contention naturally; pool only grows, never shrinks | ✓ Good |
| Deterministic instrument assignment | performerId % 3 gives stable, varied timbres without randomness | ✓ Good |
| smplr for sampled instruments | CDN-loaded piano/marimba samples — no local audio files needed | ✓ Good |
| Bjorklund/Euclidean for rhythms | Mathematically even onset distribution produces world-music-style rhythms | ✓ Good |

## Current Milestone: v1.1 MIDI

**Goal:** Add MIDI file export, velocity humanization, and default to 4 performers

**Target features:**
- Export performance as .mid file at any point (during or after playback)
- Subtle per-note velocity variation in both audio playback and MIDI output
- Default performer count of 4
