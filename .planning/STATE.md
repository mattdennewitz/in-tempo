# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-15)

**Core value:** Ensemble behavior must feel alive -- performers making believable musical decisions over a precisely timed audio engine, so each performance is unique and compelling.
**Current focus:** Phase 5 - Velocity Humanization

## Current Position

Phase: 5 of 6 (Velocity Humanization)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-15 -- Roadmap created for v1.1 MIDI milestone

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 11 (v1.0)
- Average duration: 3.5min
- Total execution time: ~0.6 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 5. Velocity | - | - | - |
| 6. MIDI Export | - | - | - |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0 decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Velocity before MIDI -- recorder needs velocity values in AgentNoteEvent
- [Roadmap]: CFG-01 (default 4 performers) bundled with velocity phase since both affect default experience
- [Research]: midi-writer-js v3.1.1 for MIDI generation (velocity scale 1-100, not 0-127)
- [Research]: Parallel integer tick counter (PPQ=480) to prevent time drift in MIDI recording

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
