# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-14)

**Core value:** Ensemble behavior must feel alive -- performers making believable musical decisions over a precisely timed audio engine, so each performance is unique and compelling.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Audio Engine + Score Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Audio Engine + Score Foundation)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 4-phase structure derived from requirements -- audio foundation first, then ensemble AI, then visuals/instruments, then alt composition modes
- [Research]: Lookahead scheduler (Chris Wilson "Two Clocks" pattern) must be correct from Phase 1; audio-visual sync bridge should be designed into scheduler even though visuals come in Phase 3
- [01-01]: AudioWorklet processor as plain JS in public/ dir for Vite compatibility
- [01-01]: Dual detuned sine oscillators (~3 cents) for warm synth voice character
- [01-01]: Score encoded as MIDI note numbers + eighth-note duration units

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- GT Canon font files need to be provided by user before Phase 3 visual identity work
- Sampled instrument audio files (piano, marimba) need to be sourced before Phase 3 instrument work
