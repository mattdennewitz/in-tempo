## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 4-phase structure derived from requirements -- audio foundation first, then ensemble AI, then visuals/instruments, then alt composition modes
- [Research]: Lookahead scheduler (Chris Wilson "Two Clocks" pattern) must be correct from Phase 1; audio-visual sync bridge should be designed into scheduler even though visuals come in Phase 3

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- GT Canon font files need to be provided by user before Phase 3 visual identity work
- Sampled instrument audio files (piano, marimba) need to be sourced before Phase 3 instrument work
